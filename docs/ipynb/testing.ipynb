    "Before running any tests, you will need to have `pytest` installed. You can install it by running\n",
    "```\n",
    "python3 -m pip install pytest testpath\n",
    "```\n",
    "on Linux and MacOS, or\n",
    "```\n",

    "The command \n",
    "```\n",
    "python3 -c \"import oommfc; oommfc.test()\"\n",

    "## (optional) More detailed installation testing instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways how we can test if our OOMMFC and OOMMF are installed correctly. To run the tests, `pytest` should be installed. To install it, run:\n",
    "```\n",
    "python3 -m pip install pytest\n",
    "```\n",
    "or\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install pytest\n",
    "```\n",
    "if you are using Windows machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To test whether oommfc and all its dependencies (except OOMMF) are installed, run:\n",
    "```\n",
    "python3 -c \"import oommfc; oommfc.test_not_oommf()\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Note: On Windows machines, please type `python`, instead of `python3`.**\n",
    "\n",
    "2. To check whether `oommfc` can find either OOMMF or Docker on the system, you can run the following commands in your Python kernel:\n",
    "```\n",
    "import oommfc\n",
    "oommfc.oommf.status()\n",
    "```\n",
    "The function `status` returns a dictionary showing whether or not OOMMF and docker can be found on the host machine. For example. {\"host\": True, \"docker\": False} means that OOMMF can be found on the host machine, but Docker cannot. If both are `False`, to diagnose the issue run:\n",
    "```\n",
    "oommfc.oommf.status(verbose=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. To get the OOMMF version on your host machine:\n",
    "```\n",
    "import oommfc\n",
    "oommfc.oommf.version(where=\"host\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "or in Docker container\n",
    "```\n",
    "import oommfc\n",
    "oommfc.oommf.version(where=\"docker\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. To run only `oommfc` tests that require OOMMF, run:\n",
    "```\n",
    "python3 -c \"import oommfc; oommfc.test_oommf()\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Note: On Windows machines, please type `python`, instead of `python3`.**\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Complete tests can be executed with:\n",
    "```\n",
    "python3 -c \"import oommfc; oommfc.test()\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Note: On Windows machines, please type `python`, instead of `python3`.**"
