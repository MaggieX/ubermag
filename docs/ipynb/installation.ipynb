    "\n",
    "To use Ubermag for micromagnetic computations, you need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. install Ubermag\n",
    "2. install a computational backend (such as OOMMF or mumax3)\n",
    "3. ensure Ubermag knows where to find the computational backend.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Installing Ubermag\n",
    "\n",
    "Ubermag is a plain Python package (Python at least version 3).\n",
    "\n",
    "The recommended installation is through conda (which makes integration with OOMMF easier, see step 3):\n",
    "\n",
    "```conda install ubermag```\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively (!), Ubermag can be installed from the PYthon Packaging Index using pip:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python3 -m pip install ubermag```\n",
    "\n",
    "To check that this worked, you can run (TODO):\n",
    "\n",
    "```ubermag --version```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: Install computational backend\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to use OOMMF for the calculations, you need to install OOMMF.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to use Mumax3 for the calculations, you need to install Mumax3.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can install both, and choose in your script which computational backend should be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing computational backend: OOMMF\n",
    "\n",
    "The recommended installation of OOMMF for Ubermag is through conda:\n",
    "\n",
    "```conda -c conda-forge install oommf```\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can install OOMMF in any other way, but will have to tell Ubermag where to find it (See Step 3): \n",
    "\n",
    "- See [OOMMF home page](https://math.nist.gov/oommf/) and \n",

    "\n",
    "## Step 3: Tell Ubermag where to find the computational backend\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Check the situation\n",
    "\n",
    "To check if Ubermag can communicate with your installed OOMMF, you can use these commands in a Python prompt:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import oommfc\n",
    "oommfc.oommf.status()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "```python3 -c \"import oommfc; oommfc.oommf.status()```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will attempt to run a small simulation using OOMMF.\n",

    "\n",
    "If the output ends like\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "OOMMF found and running.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "... then all is well: you should be able to use Ubermag with OOMMF as the computational backend.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If the output ends with\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "then Ubermag cannot find OOMMF.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Telling Ubermag where to find OOMMF\n",
    "\n",
    "If Ubermag cannot find OOMMF, you need to set an environment variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "`export OOMMFTCL=\"/path/to/your/compiled/oommf.tcl\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "which needs to point to the path of the `oommf.tcl` file that is part of your oommf installation. See also [advanced-installation.html](advanced-installation.html). "
